# UP42 Technical Support Engineer Challenge
 ðŸ‘‹ Hello UP42 ! 

 Inside this repository you will find a Jupyter Notebook (_challenge.ipynb_) containing my effort for the TSE challenge. 

You can view the notebook as a PDF in-situ on Github, or clone the repo and run it yourself.
 
## Useage

Outputs are embedded into the notebook itself, so it's not strictly necessary to run it. However, if you wish to run the notebook yourself, please clone the repo on to your local machine. <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/jsmith2-wirl/Challenge.git`

cd into the repo and build a virtual environment. <br/>
`python -m venv env` <br/>
`source env/bin/activate`

You will also need Jupyter Notebook installed into the environment. <br/>
`pip install jupyter ipykernel` <br/>
`python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=env`

Next, install the requisite modules from the requirements file.  <br/>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, simply open and run the Jupyter Notebook!
